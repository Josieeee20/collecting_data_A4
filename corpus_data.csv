WayV (Chinese: 威神V; pinyin: WēiShén V; Korean: 웨이션브이; an acronym for We are your Vision)[5] is a Chinese boy band and the fourth overall sub-unit of the South Korean boy band NCT,[6][7] managed by SM's Chinese sub-label, Label V. The group is currently composed of Kun, Ten, Winwin, Xiaojun, Hendery, and Yangyang; Lucas was part of the original lineup but departed in May 2023. The group debuted on January 17, 2019,[8] with the digital extended play (EP) The Vision.

WayV has earned accolades from both national and international award ceremonies, including Favorite Asian Artist at the 2020 Mnet Asian Music Awards and Best Dance Performance (Chinese) at the Asian Pop Music Awards for their 2021 single ""Kick Back"".[9][10]

Prior to joining SM Entertainment, some of the members were already involved in the entertainment industry. In 2011, Ten participated as a contestant in the Thai TV show Teen Superstar under the name TNT.[11] Xiaojun was a singing contestant on Zhejiang TV's survival program X-Fire in November 2015.[12]

In 2013, Ten was the first member to join the label through an SM Global audition in Bangkok, Thailand.[13][14] In 2015, Lucas was cast through an SM Global Audition in Hong Kong;[15] in July of the same year, Kun was cast in Beijing, China,[citation needed] and Winwin was street-cast at his school by an SM casting manager and passed the label's auditions.[citation needed] In February 2016, YangYang passed an audition in Taiwan.[citation needed] Hendery was street-cast in 2017, and Xiaojun was cast in 2018.[citation needed]

All seven members of WayV were originally part of SM Rookies,[16] a pre-debut team of trainees under SM Entertainment. In 2014, Ten alongside some of his co-members, appeared on the Mnet-produced Exo 90:2014, a show starring labelmates Exo, where they performed to K-pop songs from the 1990s. In April 2016, Kun sang with NCT U in the Chinese version of ""Without You"" and joined them for the song's promotional stages.[17][18] Winwin joined as dancer for NCT U's ""The 7th Sense"" [18] at their first live performance in China at the 16th Music Feng Yun Bang Awards[19] at the same month.

On January 28, 2016, SM founder and producer Lee Soo-man announced plans for a new boy group called NCT to be made up of several different units based in different cities around the world.[20]

Ten debuted with the first unit, the rotational NCT U, on April 9, 2016.[21] Although Kun sung the Chinese version of the NCT U song ""Without You"" in 2016, he was not considered a member until he and Lucas participated in NCT 2018, a project involving all members of NCT, and promotions of their album Empathy.[22][23][24] Winwin debuted as part of the second unit, the Seoul-based NCT 127, on July 10, 2016. On August 13, 2018, SM announced their plan to launch a China-based unit under the project name NCT China.[25]

The formation of WayV was announced through the group's official Weibo account on December 31.[26] The seven members were to include  four preexisting NCT members—Kun, Winwin, Ten and Lucas—along with three new members who had just been introduced through SM Rookies earlier that year—Hendery, Xiaojun, and Yangyang. The group was announced to be under SM Entertainment's new China-exclusive label, Label V.[27][7]

The group was confirmed to be a sub-unit of NCT, although they were not promoted as such until the announcement of NCT 2020.[28][29] Journalists have theorized that distancing WayV from the NCT label was a result of tense relations between China and South Korea.[28][30] Despite this, SM CEO Chris Lee acknowledged WayV as NCT's China-based unit since their formation.[6]

On January 17, 2019, WayV debuted with their first digital EP The Vision with a Chinese version of NCT 127's ""Regular"" as the lead single.[28] All three tracks of the EP placed within the top ten on Billboard World Digital Songs.[31] The group debuted at number four on the Billboard Social 50, the best debut on the chart since XXXTentacion in June 2018.[32]

WayV released their first EP Take Off with lead single with the same name on May 9.[33] The EP peaked at number seven on the Billboard World Albums Chart and charted at number one on iTunes album chart in 30 regions.[34][35] Meanwhile, the single debuted at number two on the QQ Music Weekly Popularity chart.[36]

On October 29, WayV released their second EP, Take Over the Moon, with the title track ""Moonwalk"".[37] Members Hendery and Yangyang participated in writing lyrics for the first time in the songs ""King of Hearts"" and ""We Go Nanana"". The group made their debut on the Billboard Heatseekers Albums and Korean Gaon Album Chart, ranking at number twenty-four and five, respectively.[38][39] The group had their first comeback stage for the album on MBC Music's Show Champion on October 30, marking their first performance in South Korea.[40] On November 5, the group released an English version of ""Love Talk"", which debuted and peaked at number three on the Billboard World Digital Song Sales.[41][42] The song also marked the group's first entry on QQ Music Weekly Digital Sales Chart, ranking at number two.[43] The repackaged version of the album, titled Take Over the Moon: Sequel, was released in 2020 and included the English version of ""Love Talk"" and the spoken track ""WayV.oice #1"" on the new track list.[44] The group subsequently went on a promotional tour in China, South Korea, and Thailand.[45]

In 2020, WayV was the second group from SM Entertainment to hold a live online concert, jointly organized by SM Entertainment and Naver as part of the world's first online-dedicated live concert series, Beyond LIVE. The live concert, which was WayV first-ever concert and titled WayV – Beyond the Vision, was held on May 3.[46] The group performed songs from their prior albums, as well as a mashup of ""Turn Back Time"" and ""Bad Alive"", two tracks on their first studio album Awaken the World that was set for release five weeks later on June 9, 2020.[47][48]

Awaken the World was preceded by an online game designed for smartphones, challenging players to unlock teaser images of the individual members. Additionally, individual video teasers of the members were released across different platforms.[49][50] Both the album's physical edition and the music video of its lead single ""Turn Back Time"" were released following a delay to remove potential issues with the outfits used in its promotional visual content.[51][52][53] Upon its release, WayV earned their first top-three entry on Tencent Music's UNI Chart (previously known as Yo! Bang) and the Gaon Album Chart.[54][55] The album also peaked at number nine on the Billboard World Albums chart, while ""Turn Back Time"" ranked at number twelve on the World Digital Song Sales chart.[56][57] Awaken the World became the group's first release to chart on Japanese music charts, appearing on both Billboard Japan Hot Albums and Oricon Weekly Albums Chart.[58][59] Subsequently, the group released a Korean version of ""Turn Back Time"" digitally with an accompanied similar music video.[60] On July 29, an English version of the track ""Bad Alive"" was released as a digital single.[61] The single ranked at number one on QQ Music's Daily Digital Sales chart and earned Gold certification within hours of its release.[62][63] It peaked at number six on the platform's weekly chart.[64]

WayV participated in NCT's project NCT 2020, which included members of WayV,[65] the other NCT subunits, and two new members. The group released their album in two parts, with NCT 2020 Resonance Pt. 1 released in October and NCT 2020 Resonance Pt. 2 in November, marking WayV's first official promotion as an NCT subunit and Xiaojun, Hendery, and Yangyang's official induction as NCT members.[29] For the album, WayV recorded the song ""月之迷 (Nectar)"", which debuted at number twelve on the UNI Chart.[66][67] By the end of the year, WayV received international awards from Mnet Asian Music Awards and Asia Artist Awards[68][69] and ranked third on the UNI Chart Top 10 Groups of 2020 based on their achievements on the local chart.[70]

On March 10, 2021, WayV released their third EP, Kick Back, with the lead single of the same name.[71] It would also be the final NCT album to feature Lucas due to his hiatus and eventual departure in 2023.[72] Members Winwin and Lucas were absent during the promotion of the album given they were undergoing quarantine in China for solo schedules.[73] The album became the group's first number one album on the Gaon Album Chart and eventually earned the group their first certification for selling more than 250,000 copies in South Korea.[74][75] On June 23, WayV released a new song ""Everytime"" as part of the soundtrack album for Chinese drama Falling Into Your Smile.[76][77]

WayV members participated in the promotion of NCT's third studio album Universe, released on December 14, 2021.[78] The group recorded the English song ""Miracle"" for the album.[79] Lucas and Winwin did not participate in the album, after Lucas had been suspended from any promotional activities due to cheating and gaslighting controversy,[80][81] and Winwin had established a personal studio in China.[82]

WayV announced to release their fourth EP, Phantom, on December 9, 2022.[83] The group later delayed the release to December 28 following the passing of former president of China Jiang Zemin.[84] Released almost two years from their previous EP, Phantom marks the group's first album release as a sextet.[81][85] To support the album, WayV embarked on an eponymous global fanmeeting tour, starting with two shows in Seoul on February 11.[86] WayV subsequently held their first solo event in Japan titled ""The First Vision"" at Pia Arena MM in Kanagawa on May 6–7, 2023.[87] Three days later, SM Entertainment announced that Lucas would be departing from NCT and WayV to pursue his individual endeavors.[88][89] In August to September 2023, WayV joined NCT in their three-day stadium concerts in South Korea and Japan, titled NCT Nation: To The World.[90]

WayV released their second studio album, On My Youth, on November 1, 2023.[91]

In June 2021, SM Entertainment formed the group's first sub-unit, WayV – Kun & Xiaojun. The sub-unit debuted by releasing a pop-ballad single album titled ""Back to You"".[99] In August 17, the second sub-unit, WayV – Ten & Yangyang, debuted with the hip-hop single ""Low Low"".[100] A third sub-unit, WayV – Lucas & Hendery, was scheduled to debut with a digital single titled ""Jalapeño"" on August 25, although the project was canceled due to controversy surrounding Lucas' private life.[101]

WayV has endorsed and collaborated with multiple brands, including Skechers,[102] Carslan,[103] Cigalong Beauty,[104] and Maeil Barista Rules.[105]

On July 23, 2020, WayV donated through the China Social Welfare Foundation's charity project to help victims and front-line flood relief workers in Jiangxi and Hunan.[106]

In the group's interview, WayV stated their musical influences range from Jay Chou to Rihanna, Michael Jackson, Travis Scott, Kendrick Lamar, and Justin Bieber. They also draw inspiration from their labelmates at SM Entertainment, such as Taemin from Shinee for Ten and Exo for Kun and Winwin.[107]

NCT Dream (Korean: 엔시티 드림; RR: Ensiti Deurim) is the third sub-unit of the South Korean boy band NCT, formed by SM Entertainment in 2016. They were initially intended to be the teenaged unit of NCT with an admission-and-graduation system, in which members would leave after reaching age of majority (20 in Korean age reckoning, 19 internationally), prior to re-branding in 2020. The sub-unit debuted on August 25, 2016, with the single ""Chewing Gum"" and a lineup of seven members—Mark, Renjun, Jeno, Haechan, Jaemin, Chenle, and Jisung—whose average age was 15.6 years old. In late 2018, the group's leader, Mark, graduated from NCT Dream but returned in 2020 when the group began promoting as a fixed seven-member group.

Commercial success of their 2019 extended play (EP) We Boom made NCT Dream into one of the year's top 10 physical sellers domestically  and earned them Bonsang awards at the 34th Golden Disc Awards and 2020 Seoul Music Awards.[3][4][5] Their second and last record released as a sextet was their fourth Korean-language EP, Reload (2020), which accumulated over half a million pre-orders.[6][7] NCT Dream achieved major commercial success with the release of their first studio album, Hot Sauce (2021), whose pre-orders surpassed 1.71 million copies.[8] It became the best-selling album on the Gaon Chart in the first half of 2021 and was named Best Album at the 31st Seoul Music Awards.[9][10]

Since their debut, NCT Dream have released four EPs, six singles and two studio albums and headlined one tour in Asia. Known for music reflecting youth and adolescence, growth, and the transition from innocence to rebellion,[11] the sub-unit has been recognized internationally as one of the most notable teenaged artists of their time. They are the first and only Asian artist to appear three consecutive times on Billboard's ""21 Under 21"" list for their industry impact on sales, streaming and social media, placing at numbers 20, 13 and 19 from 2018 to 2020.[12][13] NCT Dream were also included on Time's list of the ""25 Most Influential Teens"" of 2018.[11]

Prior to the group's debut, some of the members were already involved in the entertainment industry. Jeno had filmed various commercials as a child. Jisung was also previously a child actor with roles in films such as Boys, Be Curious (2012), No Cave (2013), and Go, Stop, Murder (2013) and a member of Poppin' Hyun Joon Kids Crew. Chenle was active on the Chinese music scene as a child singer; he released three albums, headlined a solo concert in China, and participated in Chinese programs, including China's Got Talent.

Mark was the first member to join SM Entertainment in 2012, after passing SM Global Auditions in Canada. Haechan was cast through SM Saturday Open Casting Audition in 2013, Jisung and Jeno were cast through the company's casting system, and Jaemin was street-cast by staff while doing volunteer work and successfully passed auditions. In July 2015, Renjun was cast through SM Global Auditions in China. Chenle was the last member to be cast, in 2016, just three months before NCT Dream's debut.[14]

Mark, Jeno, Haechan, Jaemin, and Jisung were previously part of SM Rookies, a pre-debut team of trainees under SM Entertainment. As part of SMRookies, in October 2014, they appeared on the Mnet-produced Exo 90:2014, a show starring labelmates Exo, where they perform dances to K-pop songs from the 1990s. From July through December 2015, the five boys were Mouseketeers on Disney Channel Korea's The Mickey Mouse Club, where they performed music and dances, played games, and participated in skits.
SM Rookies Boys eventually held their own concert, the SMRookies Show, which took place in Seoul in September 2015 and later expanded to Bangkok, Thailand in February 2016.

NCT was first announced in January 2016 by Lee Soo-man at a presentation outlining plans for a group that would debut different sub-units around the world.[15] Mark had previously debuted with the group's first unit, the rotational NCT U, on April 4, 2016.[16] On July 7 of the same year, both Mark and Haechan debuted in NCT's second sub-unit, the Seoul-based NCT 127.[17] They debuted again with five new members—Renjun, Jeno, Jaemin, Chenle and Jisung—as NCT Dream, the third sub-unit of NCT, announced on August 18, 2016.[18]

NCT Dream released their debut single ""Chewing Gum"" on August 24, 2016, and held their debut stage on August 25 on M Countdown.[19] The song peaked at number two on the Billboard World Digital Songs Sales chart and at number 23 on the Spotify Viral 50 chart upon release.[20] The Korean and Mandarin versions of the song were later included in NCT Dream's first single album.

On February 1, 2017, SM Entertainment announced NCT Dream's first single album, although member Jaemin would not participate in order to recover from his herniated disc injury.[21] The group's single album The First was released on February 9 with lead single ""My First and Last"".[20] The album debuted at number one on the Gaon Album Chart.[22] The sub-unit had their comeback stage on M Countdown, performing ""My First and Last"" and the B-side track ""Dunk Shot"".[23] On February 14, NCT Dream won first place on the hundredth episode of The Show, marking the first music show win for any NCT unit.[24]

In the same month, NCT Dream was appointed the official ambassadors for the 2017 FIFA U-20 World Cup, hosted in South Korea in the summer of 2017. On March 15, NCT Dream released the official song for the tournament, ""Trigger the Fever"", and performed it at different promotional events and at the opening ceremony of the U-20 World Cup.[25][26]

NCT Dream released their first EP, We Young, on August 17, 2017.[27] The group's first promotional performance for the EP was held on M Countdown.[28] We Young peaked at number three on the Billboard World Albums chart in September.[29]

NCT Dream released a Christmas single, ""Joy"", as part of the SM Station project on December 15, 2017.[29]

NCT Dream promoted alongside NCT U and NCT 127 as NCT 2018 during the first quarter of 2018. On March 4, 2018, NCT Dream released the single ""Go"", which was included in NCT's first album NCT 2018 Empathy.[30] The song marked a transition in the narrative of NCT Dream's music from the portrayal of innocence to the ""more defiant attitude"" of teenagers.[30] It also marked the group's first comeback with Jaemin since their debut.

SM Entertainment announced in late August that NCT Dream would release an EP titled We Go Up in September.[31] On August 27, it was confirmed that the album would be Mark's last comeback with the group before graduating in 2019 upon turning 19 years old, the age of majority in South Korea.[32] The EP was released on September 3, 2018, alongside the lead single of the same name.[33] We Go Up entered Billboard's World Albums chart at number five and its Heatseekers Albums chart at number seven, NCT Dream's then best sales week in the U.S.[34] The album also topped iTunes Albums charts in 15 countries.[11]
NCT Dream was featured on the ""21 Under 21 2018: Music's Next Generation"" list by Billboard as the only Asian artist that year.[12] All members were also listed on Time's 25 Most Influential Teens of 2018 list.[11]

On December 19, it was announced Haechan would be taking a hiatus from the group due to injury, but he returned soon afterwards.[35] On December 27, NCT Dream released their third single of the year, ""Candle Light"", for SM Station.[36][37] The song was a message of gratitude and love, with lyrics written by Mark, the last song featuring the original seven members of the group before Mark officially graduated from the unit on December 31.[38]

In March 2019, NCT Dream's Korean members Jeno, Jaemin and Jisung went to Malaysia to represent K-pop stars at the event ""K-Wave & Halal Show"", celebrating and meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and the First Lady of South Korea.[39]

On June 6, NCT Dream released ""Don't Need Your Love"", a collaborative single with English singer HRVY. The song showed a more mature side for the group, and they were credited for highlighting their maturing vocals. Haechan did not partake in the single due to ongoing activities with NCT 127. The song was released as part of SM Station Season 3.[40]

In July, NCT Dream were named the first global ambassadors of the World Scout Foundation and released the English-language single ""Fireflies"", the proceeds of which were used to fund foundation activities in low-income countries. The group also performed at the 24th World Scout Jamboree in West Virginia, United States on July 23.[41]

On July 26, NCT Dream released their third EP We Boom and its title track ""Boom"".[42] The album sold more than 300,000 units after a month of release.[43] It also debuted at number seven on the Billboard World Albums chart, and NCT Dream ranked at number three on the Billboard Social 50 Chart.[44] NCT Dream received two wins for ""Boom"" on The Show on August 6 and August 20, respectively.[45][46] The EP earned them Bonsang Awards at the 34th Golden Disc Awards and 2020 Seoul Music Awards.[3][4]

In September, NCT Dream was included in Billboard's 21 Under 21 list for the second year in a row, being the first Asian artists to make the list for two consecutive years, this time rising to position thirteen.[13]

In November, the group featured on American-Canadian boy band PrettyMuch's INTL:EP with the song ""Up To You"", its lyrics praised for promoting consent.[47]

The group went on their first international concert tour, The Dream Show, starting with three dates in Seoul and two dates in Bangkok from November to December.[48][49]

On January 22, NCT Dream released a Japan-exclusive compilation album titled The Dream, consisting of all previously released singles in their original Korean language.[50][51]  The album debuted atop the Oricon Albums Chart.[52]

In early 2020, NCT Dream continued with their international tour The Dream Show, with shows in multiple cities in Japan as well as in Southeast Asian countries. Shows from February 2020 onwards were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[53][54]

As the topic of member graduation became more pressing since the year prior,[55] SM Entertainment announced on April 14 that NCT Dream would release their fourth Korean EP, Reload, with the current six members Renjun, Jeno, Haechan, Jaemin, Chenle, and Jisung to mark a new change in concept. At the end of the album's promotion period, the graduation system would be abolished, and NCT Dream would continue with all seven members upon the return of Mark. NCT Dream would function as a fixed group and explore more diverse concepts with each release. The seven members would continue retain the name NCT Dream and possibly take part in other activities and NCT units in the future.[6][56][57]

By April 28, one day before the EP's release and two weeks after its announcement, Reload garnered over 500,000 pre-orders, making it NCT Dream's most pre-ordered release to date.[7] On April 29, NCT Dream released Reload with its lead single ""Ridin'"", an urban trap track with lyrics highlighting the aspirations of NCT Dream in their coming new path.[58] The music video for ""Ridin"" was released on the same day.[59] Upon release, the album topped the iTunes album chart in 49 countries, including the U.S., as well as topping the digital album sales chart of China's largest music site, QQ Music.[60][61] In South Korea, ""Ridin'"" reached number one on its largest music site, Melon, making it the first track released by an NCT unit to top the chart. All five songs from the EP peaked within the top 10 on Melon digital chart.[62] The following week, NCT Dream ranked number one on Billboard's Emerging Artists chart.[63]

After the release of their fourth Korean EP, NCT Dream was the third group from SM Entertainment to hold a live online concert, titled ""Beyond the Dream Show"", as part of the world's first online-dedicated live concert series Beyond LIVE. The live concert was held on May 10.[64]

NCT Dream joined the rest of NCT under the NCT 2020 moniker, promoting the group's second full-length album, the two-part NCT 2020 Resonance, which was released in October and November. By end of 2020, both parts of Resonance sold over 2.6 million copies, a new sales record for NCT. Included in the album is ""Déjà Vu"", performed by NCT Dream and Mark's first release with NCT Dream since its reorganization.[65] Metro praised ""Déjà Vu"" for blending the youthful sound of NCT Dream with more edge and ranked it among the top 20 K-pop comebacks of 2020.[66]

On May 10, 2021, the group released their first studio album Hot Sauce, featuring the original seven members of the unit. The album consists of ten tracks, including the title track of the same name.[67] Pre-orders for the album surpassed 1,716,571 copies, breaking their previous record for Reload with a 243% increase.[8][68] The album topped the Gaon Album Chart, and ""Hot Sauce"" became the sub-unit's first single to peak at number one on the Gaon Digital Chart.[69] On May 26, they earned the ""double million sellers"" title as the album sold more than two million copies.[70] On June 28, 2021, the group released the repackage of their first studio album Hello Future, which contained three new tracks, including the lead single of the same name.[71] Combined sales of Hot Sauce and Hello Future surpassed three million copies, earning the group their first ""triple million seller"" title.[72]

On February 28, 2022, it was announced that the group would release their second studio album, Glitch Mode, on March 28, which contained eleven new tracks, including the lead single of the same name.[73] Pre-orders for the album surpassed more than two million copies on the day of release, breaking their previous personal record of 1.71 million pre-orders for Hot Sauce.[74] Glitch Mode recorded sales of 2,100,339 copies within one week, breaking the group's previous personal record of two million copies sold in 16 days for Hot Sauce.[75] The album debuted at number 50 on the US Billboard 200 dated April 9, 2022, becoming NCT Dream's first entry on the chart.[76] On May 30, 2022, the group released the repackage of their second studio album Beatbox, which contained four new tracks, including the lead single of the same name.[77] Following the release of Glitch Mode and Beatbox, the group embarked on The Dream Show 2: In A Dream world tour. A concert film, NCT Dream The Movie: In A Dream, was also shown in theatres in South Korea on November 30, in Japan on December 6,[78] and in Singapore on November 30. [79]

commercial success of their 2019 extended play (ep) we boom made nct dream into one of the year's top 10 physical sellers domestically  and earned them bonsang awards at the 34th golden disc awards and 2020 seoul music awards.[3][4][5] their second and last record released as a sextet was their fourth korean-language ep, reload (2020), which accumulated over half a million pre-orders.[6][7] nct dream achieved major commercial success with the release of their first studio album, hot sauce (2021), whose pre-orders surpassed 1.71 million copies.[8] it became the best-selling album on the gaon chart in the first half of 2021 and was named best album at the 31st seoul music awards.[9][10]

NCT 127 (Korean: 엔시티 127; RR: Ensiti Il-i-chil) is the first fixed and second overall sub-unit of the South Korean boy band NCT, formed and managed by SM Entertainment. They originally debuted on July 7, 2016, with their debut extended play NCT #127, with an original lineup of seven members: Taeil, Taeyong, Yuta, Jaehyun, Winwin, Mark, and Haechan. Three members Doyoung and Johnny joined the unit in December 2016, ahead of their second EP Limitless, while Jungwoo, the final member, was introduced in September 2018 ahead of their first studio album Regular-Irregular. They are known for their experimental hip hop-based music, which they refer to as ""neo music"", as well as their vocal and rap abilities, choreographies, and performances.

After debuting in 2016, they broke into the domestic mainstream in 2017 with ""Cherry Bomb"", now recognized as one of their signature songs, and received greater international attention following the release of ""Kick It"" in 2020.

In April 2019, NCT 127's increasing global popularity prompted SM Entertainment to sign marketing and distribution deals with Capitol Music Group and Caroline Distribution, respectively. The unit subsequently released the EP We Are Superhuman that year and their second Korean studio album, Neo Zone, in 2020, the latter becoming their first top-five entry on the US Billboard 200 and their first release to sell over one million copies.[3] In 2021, NCT 127 released their third Korean studio album, Sticker, and its repackaged version Favorite. With a combined 3.58 million copies sold, it broke the record for the best-selling album of all time by an act under SM Entertainment and earned the group the Daesang[b] award at the 31st Seoul Music Awards.[5][6] Sticker debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, becoming the longest and highest-charting K-pop album in the US in 2021.[7] In 2022, NCT 127 released their fourth Korean studio album 2 Baddies, which sold 3.2 million copies and made them the second K-pop act to have three albums debut in the top five of the Billboard 200.[8][9][10]

In January 2016, SM Entertainment founder Lee Soo-man delivered a presentation at the SM Coex Artium titled ""SMTOWN: New Culture Technology 2016"".[11] Lee announced that the label planned to debut a new boy group with an ""unlimited"" number of members, in alignment with their ""culture contents"" strategy. The group would have ""sub-unit teams"" of different members from different cities around the world, and the units would collaborate with each other frequently. Lee revealed the name of the group to be NCT, an acronym of the presentation title. NCT was to be SM Entertainment's first idol group to debut since Red Velvet in August 2014 and the label's first boy group to debut since South Korean–Chinese boy band Exo in 2012.
